# Documentation Comment for README.md

This README file provides comprehensive documentation for the "Ops Random Forest Breast Cancer Classifier" project. It outlines the purpose, features, and usage of a machine learning solution designed to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Random Forest algorithm. The documentation follows best practices for clarity, reproducibility, and maintainability, making it suitable for both developers and data scientists.

## Sections Covered

- **Project Overview:** Describes the objective and scope of the project, emphasizing its application in healthcare and adherence to data science and DevOps standards.
- **Features:** Lists key functionalities, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, model persistence, API inference, and CI/CD integration.
- **Installation:** Provides step-by-step instructions for cloning the repository, setting up a virtual environment, and installing dependencies.
- **Usage:** Details the workflow for preparing data, training the model, evaluating performance, and running the API for inference.
- **Project Structure:** (To be completed) This section should describe the organization of the repository, outlining the purpose of each main directory and file (e.g., `src/` for source code, `data/` for datasets, `models/` for saved models, `tests/` for test scripts, etc.).
- **Data:** Explains the expected format and location of input datasets.
- **Model:** Documents the Random Forest model configuration and training process.
- **Evaluation:** Describes the metrics and methods used to assess model performance.
- **Contributing:** Provides guidelines for contributing to the project.
- **License:** States the licensing terms for the repository.
- **Contact:** Offers contact information for project maintainers.

## Usage
